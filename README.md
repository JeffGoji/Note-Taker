## Description <a href="description"></a>

This is a Note Taker application that uses Express.js on the back end and stores the notes into a JSON file with a unique ID for each note.
You can create, save, and delete each note.
To see it perform flawlessly and without the laggy server issues, I highly recommend downloading the app and running the [Nodeman npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) and viewing it in the browser window at localhost3001.
You can click on a previously saved note to bring it up to view it.
Applicaiton is also deployed at Heroku! Click Here to see it in action: [https://jeffs-note-keeper.herokuapp.com/](https://jeffs-note-keeper.herokuapp.com/)
